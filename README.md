# Philosophers-42
The project is about threads and forks, mutex and semaphores
> I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

## How to compile
+ Open folder `philo/` or `philo_bonus/`
+ To compile:
  + `make`
+ To remove objects:
  + `make clean`
+ To remove objects and binary file (program):
  + `make fclean`
+ To re-compile:
  + `make re`
+ Execute:
  + `./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`
  
  Example: `./philo 5 800 200 200 7`

## Global rules
You have to write a program for the mandatory part and another one for the bonus part (if you decide to do the bonus part). They both have to comply with the following rules:
+ Global variables are forbidden!
+ Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments: `number_of_philosophers` `time_to_die time_to_eat` `time_to_sleep` `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`
  + `number_of_philosophers`: The number of philosophers and also the number of forks.
  + `time_to_die (in milliseconds)`: If a philosopher didnâ€™t start eating time_to_die milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the sim- ulation, they die.
  + `time_to_eat (in milliseconds)`: The time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time, they will need to hold two forks.
  + `time_to_sleep (in milliseconds)`: The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.
  + `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` (optional argument): If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a philosopher dies.
+ Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.
+ Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers. Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philoso- pher number N + 1.

About the logs of your program:
+ Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:
  + `timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork`
  + `timestamp_in_ms X is eating`
  + `timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping`
  + `timestamp_in_ms X is thinking`
  + `timestamp_in_ms X died`
 
Replace `timestamp_in_ms` with the current timestamp in milliseconds and X with the philosopher number.
+ A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.
+ A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms after the actual death of the philosopher.
+ Again, philosophers should avoid dying!

## Mandatory part
The specific rules for the mandatory part are:
+ Each philosopher should be a thread.
+ There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table.
+ To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a mutex for each of them.

## Bonus part
The program of the bonus part takes the same arguments as the mandatory program. It has to comply with the requirements of the Global rules chapter.
The specific rules for the bonus part are:
+ All the forks are put in the middle of the table.
+ They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a semaphore.
+ Each philosopher should be a process. But the main process should not be a philosopher.
